<A NAME="OPERATIONAL DESCRIPTION">

<H3><CENTER>OPERATIONAL DESCRIPTION</CENTER>
</H3></A> <BR>

<P>
This write up is rudimentary and assumes that the user is experienced with
computers, and as an example assumes a PC with a Windows OS.
Other systems operate essentially the same.
<P>
The WORDS program, Version 1.97E, with it's accompanying data files should
run on PC in Windows 95/98/NT, any monitor.  Simply download the
self-extracting EXE file and execute it in your chosen subdirectory/folder to
UNZIP the files into a subdirectory of a hard disk.  Then call WORDS.
<P>
There are a number of files associated with the program.  These must be in
the subdirectory/folder of the program, and the program must be run from that
subdirectory.  WORDS.EXE is the executable program.  INFLECT.SEC holds the
encoded inflection records.  STEMFILE.GEN contains the stems of the
GENERAL dictionary in a searchable form.
DICTFILE.GEN is an indexed form of the GENERAL dictionary entries with form
information and meanings.  INDXFILE.GEN contains a set of indexes into the
DICTFILE.  In some versions, there may be a set of files for a SPECIAL (.SPE)
dictionary of the same structure as the GENERAL dictionary, but there is
no SPECIAL dictionary in the present distribution.  A LOCAL dictionary may
also be used.  This is a limited dictionary of a different form, human
readable and writeable.  The knowledgeable user can augment and modify it
on-line.  It would consist of the file DICT.LOC.  UNIQUES.LAT contains
certain words which regular processing does not get.  ADDONS.LAT contains
the set of prefixes, suffixes and enclitics (-que, -ve) and the like.
Other files may be generated by the program, so run it in a configuration
that allows the creation of files.
<P>
All these files are necessary to run the program (except the optional
dictionaries SPE and LOC).  This excess of files is a consequence of the
present developmental nature of the program.  The files are very simple,
almost human-readable.  Presumably, a later version could condense and
encode them.  Nevertheless, beyond the original COPY, the user need not
worry about them.
<P>
Additionally, there are files that the program may produce on request.
All of these share the name WORD, with various extensions, and they are
all ASCII/DOS text files which can be viewed and processed with an ordinary
editor.  The casual user may not want to get involved with
these.  WORD.OUT will record the whole output, WORD.UNK will list only
words the program is unable to interpret.  These outputs are turned on
through the PARAMETERS mechanism.
<P>
PARAMETERS may be changed while running the program by inputting a line
containing a '#' mark as the only (or first) character.  Alternatively,
WORD.MOD contains the MODES that can be set by CHANGE_PARAMETERS.  If this
file does not exist, default modes will be used.  The file may be produced
or changed when changing parameters.  It can also be modified, if the user
is sufficiently confident, with an editor, or deleted, thereby reverting
to defaults.
<P>
There is another set of developers parameters which may be set
with the input of '!'.  These MODES may be changed and saved in a
file WORD.MDV.  These are not normal user facilities, probably no one but
the developer would be interested.  In any specific release these
facilities may, or may not, work.  They are just mentioned here in case
they ever come up accidentally, and to point out that there are other
capabilities, actual and possible, which may be invoked if there is a
special need.  The user is invited to review these parameters to see
if any address an unusual need.
<P>
WORD.OUT is the file produced if the user requests
output to a file.  This output can be used for later manipulation with a
text editor, especially when the input was a text file of some length.  If
the parameter UNKNOWNS_ONLY is set, the output serves as a sort of a Latin
spell checker.  Those words it cannot match may just not be in the
dictionary, but alternatively they may be typos.  A WORD.UNK file of
unknowns can be generated.
<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="Program Operation">
<H4>Program Operation</H4></A>

<P>
To start the program, in the subdirectory that contains all the files,
type WORDS.  A setup procedure will execute, processing files.  Then the
program will ask for a word to be keyed in.  Input the word and give a
return (ENTER).  Information about the word will be displayed.
<P>
One can input a whole line at a time, however long,
but only one line since the return
at the end of line will start the processing.  If the results would fill
more than a computer screen, the output is halted until the user responds
to the 'MORE' message with a return.  A file containing a text, a series
of lines, can be input by keying in the character '@', followed (with no
spaces) by the DOS name of the file of text.  This input file need not be
in the program subdirectory, just use the full path and name of the
file.  This is usually accompanied with the setting of the parameter
switches to create and write to an output file, WORD.OUT.
<P>
One can have a comment in the file, a terminal portion of a line that is
not parsed.  This could be an English meaning, a source where the word was
found, an indication that it may have been miscopied, etc.  A comment
begins with a double dash [--] and continues to the end of the line.  The
'--' and everything after on that line is ignored by the program.
<P>
A simple # character input at the start of a line (that is, a line
containing only #) will permit the user to set modes to prevent the
process from trying prefixes and suffixes to get a match on an item
unknown to the dictionary, put output to a file, etc.  Going into the
CHANGE_PARAMETERS, the '?' character calls help for each entry.
<P>
Another set of parameters is invoked by the character !.  These developer parameters
are fairly specialized and are probably not required by the average user,
nevertheless they are available for special applications.
<P>
Two successive returns with no text will terminate the program (except in
text being read from an @ disk file.)

<A NAME="Modes of Operation">
<H4>Modes of Operation</H4></A>

<P>The mode of operation of WORDS can be specialized by setting some combination
of available parameters.  Here are a couple of example situations.

<P>If you want only meanings to show up, set the # parameter
<BR>
DO_ONLY_MEANINGS => Yes
<BR>
<P>If you do not even want to see the dictionary form (principle parts) set
# parameter
<BR>
DO_DICTIONARY_FORM => No
<BR>
<P>If you want to accept only the dictionary entry (amo, but not amas), set
the ! parameter (this is the tricky one, requiring two parameters set)
<BR>
DO_ONLY_INITIAL_WORD => Yes
<BR>
<P>This will ten require you to input one enrty per line, which is not
unreasonable for a dictionary look-up process.  Then you will be offered
another, otherwise unavailable, option
<BR>
FOR_WORD_LIST_CHECK => Yes
<BR>
<P>There are a large number of other options.  The user is invited
to consider all the options if needing anything more than the basic parse.

<P>Of course, for both sets of parameters, you will want to go to the end
of the parameter setting menu and save this set so you can restart with
the same situation.



<A NAME="Command Line Operation">
<H4>Command Line Operation</H4></A>


The main mode of usage for WORDS is a simple call, followed by screen interaction.
<P>
But there are other, command line, options.
WORDS may be called with arguments on the same line, in a number of different modes.
The program will execute with these arguments as input.
Remember that the saved parameter settings (in WORD.MOD and WORD.MDV)
are controlling, even for command line input.

<P>
Single argument, either a simple Latin word or an input file.

<P>
WORDS amo
<BR>which will cause it to execute for that input and then terminate.  This is
for a quick word.

<P>
WORDS infile
<BR>causes WORDS to execute with the contents of the inflie.
The infile may be from any folder if the full path name is given.

<P>
With two arguments the options are: inputfile and outputfile,
two Latin words, or a language shift to English (Latin being the startup default)
and an English  word (with no part of speech).

<P>
WORDS infile outfile
<BR>The program will read as input the INFILE and write
the output to the OUTFILE (as though it were WORD.OUT).  It will then
await further input from the user.  It terminates with a return.  If the
parameters are not legal file names, the program will assume they are
Latin words to be processed as command line input.

<P>
WORDS amo amas

<P>
WORDS ^e  love
<BR>switches to English input from the default Latin and searches for love.

<P>
With three arguments there could be three Latin words or a language shift
and and English word and part of speech.

<P>
WORDS amo amas amat

<P>
WORDS ^e love v

<P>
More than three arguments must all be Latin words.

<P>
WORDS amo amas amat amamus amatis amant

<P>
There cannot be more than one English word in the argument list,
since there can only be one English word per line for WORDS input.


<P>
An input file (either from interactive with @ or from command line)
can have changes of language, but the ^E or ^L must be on a seperate line.
Note that this capability can create confusing situations.
An input file that starts off Latin then switches to English will be
correctly processed.  But if it is followed by a similiar input file, the
second file will start off English (from the setting in the earlier file) and fail
on the Latin input.  Thus even submitting the same file twice in a run
will give different results.  Ithis problem can be alleviated by starting each
input file with an explicit language instruction, but this will not normally be
the situation.




<A NAME="Latin-to-English Examples">
<H4>Latin-to-English Examples</H4>
<P>
Following are annotated examples of output.  Examination of these will
give a good idea of the system.  The present version may not match these
examples exactly - things are changing - but the principle is there.  A
recent modification is the output of dictionary forms or 'principal parts'
(shown below for some examples).

<PRE><TT>=>agricolarum
agricol.arum         N      1 1 GEN P M
agricola, agricolae  N    M   [XAXBO]
farmer, cultivator, gardener, agriculturist; plowman, countryman, peasant;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
This is a simple first declension noun, and a unique interpretation.  The
'1 1' means it is first declension, with variant 1. This is an internal
coding of the program, and may not correspond exactly with the grammatical
numbering.  The 'N' means it is a noun.  It is the form for genitive
(GEN), plural ('P').  The stem is masculine (M).
The stem is given as 'agricol' and the ending is
'arum'.  The stem is normal in this case, but is a product of the program,
and may not always correspond to conventional usage.

<P>On the next line is given the expansion of the form that one might find
in a paper dictionary, the nominitive and genitive (agricola, agricolae).
The [XAXBO] is an internal code of the program and is documented below as Dictionary Codes.
Several codes are associated with each dictionary entry (presently AGE, AREA, GEO, FREQ, SOURCE).
These provide some information to enhance the interpretation of the dictionary entry.
In this case, the interesting piece is the B, which signifies
that this word is found frequently in texts, in the top 10 percent.
The O says it has been verified in the Oxford Latin Dictionary.
The A says it is an agrigultural word.

<P>The declension/conjugation numbers for nouns and verbs are
essentially arbitary (but will be familiar to Latin students).
The variants are complete inventions.
They have no real meaning, just codes for the program.

<P>(In the case of adjectives, they are even more arbitary,
although a Latin student might see how I came by them.
Again they are only codes for the program.
The initial release of the program did not put these out,
but there is some interest on the part of students, so they are now included.
The user may ignore them altogether.
There is no relation between the declension/variant codes of a noun
and the accompaning adjective.
They only agree in case, number, and gender (NOM S N),
which are listed in the output.)


<PRE><TT>=>feminae
femin.ae             N      1 1 GEN S F
femin.ae             N      1 1 DAT S F
femin.ae             N      1 1 NOM P F
femin.ae             N      1 1 VOC P F
femina, feminae  N    F   [XXXAX]
woman; female;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
This word has several possible interpretations in case and number
(Singular and Plural).  The gender is Feminine.  Presumably, the user can
examine the adjoining words and reduce the set of possibilities.

<PRE><TT>=>cornu
corn.u               N      4 1 ABL S F
cornus, cornus  N    F   [XXXCO]
cornel-cherry-tree (Cornus mas); cornel wood; javelin (of cornel wood);
corn.u               N      4 2 NOM S N
corn.u               N      4 2 DAT S N
corn.u               N      4 2 ABL S N
corn.u               N      4 2 ACC S N
cornu, cornus  N    N   [XXXAO]
horn; hoof; beak/tusk/claw; bow; horn/trumpet; end, wing of army; mountain top;
*
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Here is an example of another declension and two variants.  The
Masculine (and few Feminine) (-us) nouns of the declension are '4 1' and the Neuter
(-u) nouns are coded as '4 2'.  This word has both.
The horn parse is very frequent (A), while the cornel option (C) is
less so but still common.


<PRE><TT>=>ego
ego                  PRON   5 1 NOM S C
 [XXXAX]
I, me; myself;</TT></PRE>

<P>
A pronoun is much like a noun.  The gender is common (C), that is, it may
be masculine or feminine.  For some odd words, especially including pronouns,
there is no dictionary form given.

<PRE><TT>=>illud
ill.ud               PRON   6 1 NOM S N
ill.ud               PRON   6 1 ACC S N
ille, illa, illud  PRON   [XXXAX]
that; those (pl.); also DEMONST; that person/thing; the well known; the former;
*
</TT></PRE>
<P>The asterisk means that there are other, less probable forms which have been
trimmed, but which may be recovered by running with the TRIM parameter reset.

<PRE><TT>=>hic
h.ic                 PRON   3 1 NOM S M
hic, haec, hoc  PRON   [XXXAX]
this; these (pl.); also DEMONST;
hic                  ADV    POS
hic                 ADV   [XXXCX]
here, in this place; in the present circumstances;</TT></PRE>

<P>
In this case there is a adjectival/demonstrative pronoun, or it may be an
adverb.  The POS means that the comparison of the adverb is positive.

<PRE><TT>=>bonum
bon.um               N      2 1 ACC S M
bonus, boni  N    M   [XXXCO]
good/moral/honest/brave man; man of honor, gentleman; better/rich people (pl.);
bon.um               N      2 2 NOM S N
bon.um               N      2 2 ACC S N
bonum, boni  N    N   [XXXAO]
good, good thing, profit, advantage; goods (pl.), possessions, wealth, estate;
bon.um               ADJ    1 1 NOM S N POS
bon.um               ADJ    1 1 ACC S M POS
bon.um               ADJ    1 1 ACC S N POS
bonus, bona -um, melior -or -us, optimus -a -um  ADJ   [XXXAO]
good, honest, brave, noble, kind, pleasant, right, useful; valid; healthy;
*
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Here we have an adjective, but it might also be a noun.  The
interpretation of the adjective says that it is POSitive, and that
is the meaning listed, as is the convention for all dictionaries.
The user must generate form this the meanings for other comparisons.
Check the comparison value before deciding on the real meaning.
Again, there is an asterisk, indicating further inflected forms were trimmed out.

<PRE><TT>=>facile
facil.e              ADJ    3 2 NOM S N POS
facil.e              ADJ    3 2 ABL S X POS

facile               ADV    POS
facile, facilius, facillime  ADV   [XXXBO]
easily, readily, without difficulty; generally, often; willingly; heedlessly;
*
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Here is an adjective or and adverb.  Although they are related in meaning,
they are different words.

<PRE><TT>=>acerrimus

acer, acris -e, acrior -or -us, acerrimus -a -um  ADJ   [XXXAO]
sharp, bitter, pointed, piercing, shrill; sagacious, keen; severe, vigorous;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Here we have an adjective in the SUPERlative.  The meanings are all
POSitive and the user must add the -est by himself.

<PRE><TT>=>optime
optime               ADV    SUPER
bene, melius, optime  ADV   [XXXAO]
well, very, quite, rightly, agreeably, cheaply, in good style; better; best;
opti.me              ADJ    1 1 VOC S M SUPER
bonus, bona -um, melior -or -us, optimus -a -um  ADJ   [XXXAO]
good, honest, brave, noble, kind, pleasant, right, useful; valid; healthy;
</TT></PRE>

<P>Here is an adjective or and adverb, both are SUPERlative.

<PRE><TT>=>monuissemus

</TT></PRE>

<P>
Here is a verb for which the form is PLUPerfect, ACTIVE, SUBjunctive, 1st
person, Plural.  It is 2nd conjugation, variant 1.

<PRE><TT>=>amat
am.at                V      1 1 PRES ACTIVE  IND 3 S

Another regular verb, PRESent, ACTIVE, INDicative.

<PRE><TT>=>amatus

amatus, amata, amatum  ADJ   [XXXEO]    uncommon
loved, beloved;
</TT></PRE>

<P>
Here we have the PERFect, PASSIVE ParticiPLe, in the NOMinative, Singular,
Masculine.   In addition, there is the ADJective that is formed from
this participle.  If the ADJective is common, it will likely have its own
dictionary entry.  Sometimes there may be a special or idiomatic meaning
not obvious from the verb, or the meaning may stray from the original.
In this case, the verb is very frequent, but the use as a adjective is uncommon.

<PRE><TT>=>amatu
amat.u               SUPINE 1 1 ABL S N
amo, amare, amavi, amatus  V   [XXXAO]

<P>
For DEPondent verbs the passive form is to be translated as if it were
active voice, so there is no VOICE given in the output.

<PRE><TT>=>ab

<P>
Here is a PREPosition that might also be a Verb or a Noun.
While as a preperation it is so common that it is unlikely
that any other use would occur, there is no way to indicate that.
Just be reminded that the frequency given for a verb is for the
sum of all the couple of hundred forms of the verb, not just
the one form that is parsed.

<PRE><TT>=>contra

<P>
Here is a PREPosition that might also be an ADVerb.  This is a very common
situation, with the meanings being much the same.

 7 - (CARD answers 'how many');</TT></PRE>

<P>
Numbers are recognized as such and given a value.
An additional provision is the attempt to recognize and display the value
of Roman numerals, even combinations of appropriate letters that do not
parse conventionally to a value but may be ill-formed Roman numerals.

<PRE><TT>=>VII

<P>Beyond simple dictionary entry words, the program
can construct additional words with prefixes, suffixes and other ADDONS.

<PRE><TT>=>populusque
que                  TACKON
-que = and (enclitic, translated before attached word); completes plerus/uter;
popul.us             N      2 1 NOM S M
populus, populi  N    M   [XXXAO]
people, nation, State; public/populace/multitude/crowd; a following;
members of a society/sex; region/district (L+S); army (Bee);
</TT></PRE>

<P>Here the input word is recognized as a combination of a base word
and an enclitic (-que) tacked on.  This particular enclitic is
extremely common and its omission, or the omission of the process
that handles it, would result in an very large number of UNKNOWNs
in the output.



<PRE><TT>=>pseudochristus
pseudo               PREFIX
false, fallacious, deceitful; sperious; imitation of;
christ.us            N      2 1 NOM S M
Christus, Christi  N    M   [XEXAO]
Christ;</TT></PRE>

<P>Here there is a prefix and a base.  The user must make the combination
into a word or phrase.

<P>
Generally, the meaning is given for the base word, as is usual for
dictionaries.  For the verb, it will be a present meaning, even when the
tense given is perfect.  For a noun, it will be the singular, and the user
must interpret when the form is plural.

<P>For an adjective, the positive meaning is given,
even if a comparative or superlative form is output.
The user is invited to expand to
comparative (-er) and superlative (-est).
For a few adjectives, the only stem in the dictionary is COMP or SUPER.
When there is just one comparison,
the WORDS dictionary gives that expanded meaning.
This might be considered inconsistant,
in that it expects the user to observe the FORM to interpret the meaning,
but it is consisent with ordinary dictionary practice.


<P>Initially there were more defective adjective entries.
I had accepted assertions in OLD or L+S and others like
'comparative does not exist'.
Later on I went over to the position that
even if theCicero did not use it, someone might.
I started generating COMP and SUPER where it seemed reasonable.
One can also count on a suffix to correct most omissions, and it will.

<P>Sometimes a word is constructed from a suffix and a stem of a different
part of speech.
Thus an adverb may be constructed from its adjective.
It will show the base adjective meaning and an indication of how to
make the adverb in English.  The user must make the proper interpretation.

<P>
In some cases an adjective will be found that is a participle of a verb
that is also found.  The participle meaning, as inferred by the user from
the verb meaning, is not superseded by the explicit adjective entry, but
supplemented by it with possible specialized meanings.  <BR>

<P>~E (tilde E/e plus Enter/CR)
changes mode from Latin-to-English to English-to-Latin.  ~L changes back.

<P>A single input English word is followed by the desired part of speech.
Omitting the part of speech defaults to all, which is not recommended
for any word which can be ambiguous.  Since the program is looking for a
part of speech, it would be inconvenient to support the input of several
English words on a line.  While a (@) file of words can be processed in the
English mode, it must be one word per line.

<P>Output looks much like a paper dictionary entry, with form, part of speech,
gender, etc.  Also included are the WORDS coded declension/conjugation and the
TRANS flags, which give age, frequency and source, information for the user
in selecting the best trnslation.  The output may also contain a vertical bar
leading the meaning.  This is a continuation symbol which states that there
are other meanings for the Latin word.  The user might want to run the Latin
phase of WORDS to get the full set of meanings so that no unintended conflicts
appear.

<P>While six prioritized translations may seem like enough,
and they will likely cover the needs of a student, the full set
(setting # parameter to not TRIM) contains much valuable information
for the advanced translator.  For instance for the verb live vivo
usually works, but there are other options associated with specific
situations: cohabito meand live together, ruror means live in the country,
adjaceo means live near, judaizo means live in the Jewish manner keeping the law.
These sorts of meanings are often conveyed in Latin by a single word,
while in English one might just use live and a modifing word or phrase.

<A NAME="Design of the Meaning Line">
<H4>Design of the Meaning Line</H4></A>

<P>The role and complexity of the WORDS meaning line has evolved over time.
Initially it reflected an elementry, back-of-the-book,  textbook dictionary
with a single word or two for each entry.
Nevertheless, the size of the MEAN element was set at 80 characters
(as God, Holerith and IBM decreed),
as appropriate for a standard computer screen in text mode.
(Depending on the system and mode of display, the output
may be limited to 78 or 79 characters, but the traditional 80
characters of the century-old IBM card was chosen.
They will likely appear on printed output.)


<P>With expansion of the dictionary beyond a few thousand elementary seentries
and the extensive inclusion of the Oxford dictionaries,
a much larger set of possible interpretations surfaced for many words,
filling and exceeding the 80 character limit.
A certain disipline was introduced to structure the line.


<P>Through the many phases of development of the
dictionary, standards were developed and modified and
rigor was not always maintained, therefore the rules
below are generally, but not universally, observed.
Evolution of the dictionary is bringing it more closely
in line with these rules.
<BR><BR>


<P>A decision was made to include as many meanings and synonyms as
convenient.  The OLD will sometimes list a dozen or more meaning
groups with notably different senses, each with several similiar meanings.
Presumably these different meanings were the product of different
translations of the Latin word, different translators,
different context, and different eras.
The WORDS dictionary includes many of these synonyms, and specifically adds
some more modern ones, in order to give the user inspiration
for his translation.
Further, it is important to give the user the full flavor of the word
that various translations employ.  A word with a nominal meaning of
respect may be found to also mean fear (which may be the basis of all
respect for the Romans), and that will certainly color the interpretation
of a passage.
Going the other way, one might not want to
apply it to a discription of Mother Teressa.
Also one should be warned if an otherwise simple word also is used as a rude
reference to female anatomy.

<P>There are a couple of other factors that may influence the user in determining
the appropriate meaning from the list.  Some words have different meanings depending
on the age.  If one is reading a text written recently in modern Latin, one must
consider hints about the meaning.  While the classical meaning, the WORDS default,
may be appropriate, if there is a line with a late AGE code or an indication
of a modern dictionary source (e.g,. Cal), the user should take this into consideration.

<A NAME="Signs and Abbreviations in Meaning">
<H5>Signs and Abbreviations in Meaning</H5></A>

, [comma] is used to separate meanings that are similar.  The philosophy
has been to list a number of synonyms just to key the reader in making his
translation.<BR>
<BR>
; [semicolon] is used to separate sets of meanings that differ in intent.
This is just a general tendency and is not always rigorously enforced.  <BR>
<BR>
: [colon] is used with an AREA code to specify a single special meaning
appropriate for that AREA in a series of general meanings.  For example,
L: has the same impact as (legal) before or after a defination in meaning.
This supplements the use of the AREA code in the set of flags, which
implies that all or most of the meanings are associated with that area.<BR>
<BR>
/ [solidus] means 'or' or gives an alternative word.  It sometimes
replaces the comma and is often used to compress the meaning into a short
line.  <BR>
<BR>
(...) [parentheses] set off and optional word or modifier, e.g., '(nearly)
white' means 'white' or 'nearly white', (matter in) dispute means either
the matter in dispute or the dispute itself.  They are also used to set
off an explanation, further information about the word or meaning, or an
example of a translation or a word combination.  <BR>
<BR>
?  [question mark] in a meaning implies a doubt about the interpretation,
or even about the existence of the word at all.  For the purposes of this
program, it does not matter much.  If the dubious word does not exist, no
one will ask for it.  If it appears in his text, the reader is warned that
the interpretation may be questionable to some degree, but is what is
available.  May indicate somewhat more doubt than (perh.).  <BR>
<BR>
~ [tilde] stands for the stem or word in question.  Usually it does not
have an ending affixed, as is the convention in other dictionaries, but
represents the word with whatever ending is proper.  It is just a space
saving shorthand or abbreviation.  <BR>
<BR>
{~ [tilde] also is the flag for changing the language base.  ~E (plus Enter/CR)
changes from Latin-to-English to English-to-Latin.  ~L changes back.)<BR>
<BR>
=&gt; in meaning this indicates a translation example.  <BR>
<BR>
abb.  abbreviation.  <BR>
<BR>
(Dif) - [Diferrari] is used to indicate an additional meaning taken from A
Latin-English Dictionary of St. Thomas Aquinas by Roy J. Diferrari.  This
is singled out because of the importance of Aquinas.  The reference is to
be applied from the last semicolon before the mark.  It is likely that the
meaning diverges from the base by being medieval and ecclesiastical, but
not so overwhelming as to deserve a separate entry.  <BR>
<BR>
(Douay) is used to designate those words for which the meaning has been
derived or modified by examination of the Douay translation of the Latin
Vulgate Bible of St Jerome.  <BR>
<BR>
(eccl.) ecclesiastical - designating a special church meaning in a list of
conventional meanings, an additional meaning not sufficient to justify a
separate entry with an ecclesiastical code.  <BR>
<BR>
esp.  [especially] - indicates a significant association, but is only
advisory.  <BR>
<BR>
(King James) or (KJames) is used to designate those words for which the
meaning has been derived or modified by examination of the King James
Bible in connection with the Latin Vulgate Bible of St Jerome.  <BR>
<BR>
(KLUDGE) This indicates that the particular form is distorted in order to
make it come out correctly.  This usually takes the form of a special
conjugational form applied to a few words, not applicable to other words
of the same conjugation or declension.  The user can expect the form and
meaning to be correct, but the numerical coding will be odd.  <BR>
<BR>
(L+S) [Lewis and Short] is used to indicate that the meaning starting from
the previous semicolon is information from Lewis and Short 'A Latin
Dictionary' that differs from, or significantly expands on, the meaning in
the 'Oxford Latin Dictionary' (OLD) which is the baseline for this
program.  This is not to imply that the meaning listed is otherwise taken
directly from the OLD, just that it is not inconsistent with OLD, but the
L+S information either inconsistent (likely OLD knows better) or Lewis and
Short has included meanings appropriate for late Latin writers beyond the
scope of OLD.  The program is just warning the reader that there may be
some difference.  There are cases in which this indication occurs in
entries that have Lewis and Short as the source.  In those cases, the
basic word is in OLD but the entry is a variant form or spelling not cited
there.  There are cases where OLD and L+S give somewhat different
spellings and meanings for the 'same' word (same in the sense that both
dictionaries point to the same citation).  In these cases a combination of
meanings are given for both entries with the (L+S) code distinction and
the entries of different spelling or declension have the SOURCE coded.  <BR>
<BR>
NT [New Testament] is a reference in the Bible.
<BR>
(OLD) [Oxford Latin Dictionary] is used to indicate an additional meaning
taken from the Oxford Latin Dictionary in an entry that is otherwise
attributed.  While it is usually true that if a classical word has other
than OLD as the listed source then it does not appear in that form in OLD,
this is not always the case.  On occasion some other dictionary gives a
much better or more complete and understandable definition and the honor
of source is thereto given.  <BR>
<BR>
OT [Old Testament] is a reference in the Bible.
<BR>
Other source indicators are occasionally used and are indicated
in the general discription of SOURCE below.
<BR><BR>
(PASS) [passive] - indicates a special, unexpected meaning for the passive
form of the verb, not easily associated with the active meaning.
In addition this is often used to remind the user that compounds of facio
form the passive by using the active of fio.  Ex: calefio (calefacio PASS).
There may be more translation information in the base word cited and
the user is encouraged to refer to it.<BR>
<BR>
perh.  [perhaps] - denotes an additional uncertainty, but not as strong as
(?).  <BR>
<BR>
(pl.) [plural] means that the Latin word is believed by scholars to be
used (almost) always in the plural form, with the meaning stated, even
though that meaning in English may be singular.  If it appears in the
beginning of the meaning, before the first comma, it applies to all the
meanings.  If it appears later, it applies only to that and later
meanings.  For the purpose of this program, this is only advisory.  While
it is used by some tools to find the expected dictionary entry, the
program does not necessarily exclude a singular form in the output.  While it may be
true that in good, classical Latin it is never used in the singular, this
does not mean that some text somewhere might not use the singular, nor
that it is uncommon in later Latin. The TRIM_OUTPUT option may cause only plural
forms to appear, with no TRIM_OUTPUT the singular will be shown. <BR>
<BR>
prob.  [probably] - denotes some uncertainty, but not as much as
(perh.).  <BR>
<BR>
pure Latin ...  indicates a pure Latin term for a word which is derived
from another language (almost certainly Greek).  <BR>
<BR>
(rude) - indicates that this meaning was used in a rude, vulgar, coarse,
or obscene manner, not what one should hear in polite company.  Such use
is likely from graffiti or epigrams, or in plays in which the dialogue is
to indicate that the characters are low or crude.  Meanings given by the
program for these words are more polite, and the user is invited to
substitute the current street language or obscenity of his choice to get
the flavor of text.  <BR>
<BR>
(sg.) [singular] means that the Latin word is believed by scholars to be
used always in the singular.  If it appears in the beginning of the
meaning, before the first comma, it applies to all the meanings.  If it
appears later, it applies only to that and later meanings.  For the
purpose of this program, this is only advisory.  <BR>
<BR>
usu.  [usually] is weakly advisory.  (usu.  pl.) is even weaker than (pl.)
and may imply that the plural tendency occurred only during certain periods.
<BR>
<BR>
w/ means 'with'.
<BR>
 <BR>
