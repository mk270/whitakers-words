WORDS
=====

This is a cleaned-up version of the port of William Whitaker's WORDS
programme, a Latin-English dictionary with inflectional morphology
support; the original author passed away in 2010, so any and all help
maintaining the software as development and execution environments evolve
would be greatly appreciated.

Effectively, this is an exercise in digital preservation.

Contributing
============

Help is needed maintaining the code for future users; in particular, it
does not currently support vowel length, so it may be necessary to gather
a group of Latin experts to adjust its lexicon of several thousand words.

If you contribute, please be sure to indicate your assent to redistributing
your contributions under the same terms as the existing software; this
will minimise copyright hassles in the future.
