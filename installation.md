Installation
============

The WORDS program, with its accompanying data files should run on any
machine for which it is adapted, any monitor.  Simply download the
self-extracting EXE files or the compressed file for the appropriate
system and execute/decompress it in your chosen subdirectory on the hard
disk, creating the necessary files.  Then call/run WORDS, or do as instructed
in any README.

The load includes SPQR.ICO, a possible icon for WORDS,
but just that, only an icon.
You have to install the program as per the directions
(put the downloaded files in a folder,
run them to expand to the WORDS system, then run from that folder).
However, If you are Windows-wise, you can use Explorer and
make a shortcut and put it on the desktop.
Windows will make a generic icon,
but you can change it (using Properties)
to whatever other icon you can find, for instance,
the one included with the package.  Or not.
Make sure that the Properties on the icon
has as Target the WORDS.EXE
in the folder in which the system is loaded.

Is There a Problem?
-------------------

* Did you download the two appropriate file(s) to your hard disk, as listed in the download page for your system?
* Can you verify that they are there and full size (megabytes as indicated)?
* Did you execute/run/unzip these programs?
* If self-extracted, were you asked where to put the generated files? (Maybe a default C:\WORDS)?
* If not, did you put them in the folder/subdirectory from which you wish to operate?
* Can you verify that the full set of files (about 10 MB) was generated in that folder/subdirectory, or wherever you chose? At least WORDS.EXE, INFLECT.SEC, UNIQUES.LAT, ADDONS.LAT, STEMFILE.GEN, INDXFILE.GEN, and DICTFILE.GEN, plus documentation.
* Did you run/execute WORDS in that folder/subdirectory?  e.g. C:\WORDS
* If when you try to run there is no WORDS.EXE (or equivalent), the system should let you know.
* If there is no INFLECTS.SEC, the program will say so and abort immediately.
* If there are no dictionary files, the program will tell you, but will start (you can get Roman numerals!).
* If there is no ADDONS.LAT or UNIQUES.LAT, the program will tell you, and if they are there it will tell you how many.
